# PortfoliOS

PortfoliOS is an Operating System inspired web portfolio built using TypeScript and NextJS.

## Thoughts

The PortfoliOS site is in some ways a Frontend & CSS challenge, meant to look similar to modern day operating systems. It blends influences from Windows 11 and Linux systems for a unique look. The application is not meant to be a functional Operating System (yet) and is more focussed on displaying my projects and experiences in a unique way, while giving me a space to try new libraries like [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/) for state management or [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

Hopefully in the future I will find more time to spend on backend related techonlogies and applications :).
